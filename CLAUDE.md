# Project: coud_demos — CyberArk Identity Scaling Demos

## What This Repo Is
Closed-loop automation demo repository using CyberArk Identity (idsec Terraform provider),
GitHub Actions, and Terraform. Use cases are modular and composable — designed so individual
demos can be stitched together to add capability incrementally.

## Architecture Pattern
```
GitHub Issue Form → GitHub Actions → CyberArk Identity (OAuth2 AuthN)
  → Terraform (idsec + AWS provider) → AWS Organization
      → Outputs stored back to CyberArk → Comment on Issue → Close Issue
```

## Current Use Cases

### 1. AWS Account Vending (`use-cases/aws-account-vending/`)
- **Trigger:** GitHub Issue labeled `provision-aws-account`
- **Form:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/aws-account-request.yml`
- **Pipeline:** `.github/workflows/aws-account-vending.yml`
- **What it does:** Authenticates to CyberArk, creates a new AWS Organizations account,
  applies IAM policies, comments result back on the issue, closes it

## Key Design Decisions (Already Made — Do Not Revisit Unless Asked)
- **CyberArk auth method:** OAuth2 confidential client (client_id + client_secret)
- **AWS credential flow:** Fetched at runtime via CyberArk — no static AWS keys ever in GitHub
- **Approval gate:** GitHub Environments (`environment: production`) — human approval required before any `terraform apply`
- **Issue parsing:** `stefanbuck/github-issue-parser@v3` maps issue form fields to job outputs
- **Terraform state:** Local for now — S3 backend is stubbed and commented out in `use-cases/aws-account-vending/main.tf`, ready to enable
- **idsec provider version:** `cyberark/idsec ~> 1.0`
- **AWS provider version:** `hashicorp/aws ~> 5.0`
- **Terraform version:** `>= 1.7.0`

## GitHub Secrets Required
| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `CYBERARK_TENANT_URL` | CyberArk tenant URL e.g. `https://abc1234.id.cyberark.cloud` |
| `CYBERARK_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth2 service account client ID |
| `CYBERARK_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth2 service account client secret |
| `AWS_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID` | 12-digit management account ID used to construct IAM ARNs |
| `AWS_POOL_OU_ID` | OU ID containing pre-staged lab accounts |
| `AWS_ACTIVE_OU_ID` | OU ID where active/assigned accounts live |

## GitHub Environment Required
- Environment name: `production`
- Setting: Required reviewers enabled
- Location: Repo → Settings → Environments

## Lab Setup

### Pool OU Accounts
Three accounts are pre-staged in the pool OU. Before running simulate mode,
ensure all three have the following tag applied in AWS Organizations:
- Key: `Status`, Value: `Available`

### Labels Required in GitHub
- `provision-aws-account` — triggers provisioning workflow
- `provisioned` — applied on successful provisioning
- `deprovision-aws-account` — triggers deprovisioning workflow
- `returned-to-pool` — applied on successful return to pool

### Demo Flow
1. Submit issue → select Simulate → apply `provision-aws-account` label
2. Approve production gate
3. Account moves from pool OU to active OU, alias updated, comment on issue
4. Demo the account
5. Submit deprovision issue → apply `deprovision-aws-account` label
6. Account returns to pool, tagged Available, ready for next demo

## AWS Prerequisites (Not Yet Configured)
- AWS Organizations management account must exist
- IAM role `GitHubActionsOrgProvisioner` needed in management account
- `GitHubActionsOrgProvisioner` IAM role must have `AWSOrganizationsFullAccess` managed policy attached (least-privilege refinement deferred)
- The role also requires `organizations:ListAccounts` for the duplicate account name check step
- Trust policy for that role: not yet written — next item to build
- Required permissions: `organizations:CreateAccount`, `organizations:ListAccounts`, `iam:*`, `sso:*`

## What's Built
- [x] GitHub Issue form (aws-account-request.yml)
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow (parse → approve → auth → terraform)
- [x] OIDC authentication to AWS (no static keys)
- [x] Duplicate account name guard
- [x] `modules/aws-account/` — creates `aws_organizations_account` (CloudTrail/GuardDuty deferred to Phase 2)
- [x] CyberArk auth module scaffold
- [x] IAM policies module scaffold
- [x] Use-case root Terraform config
- [x] README.md
- [x] Lab simulation mode — recycles pool accounts instead of creating new ones
- [x] Deprovisioning workflow — returns simulated accounts to pool
- [x] Account availability tracked via AWS resource tags (`Status = Available/InUse`)

## What's NOT Built Yet (Next Phases)

### Phase 2 — Baseline Security in Child Accounts
- [ ] CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and account alias in newly created accounts
- [ ] Requires a separate Terraform apply pass after account ID is known
      (blocked by aws.child provider chicken-and-egg on first apply)
- [ ] New module: `modules/aws-baseline-security/`

### Phase 3 — CyberArk Identity Access Provisioning (PRIMARY DEMO STORY)
This is the core CyberArk narrative: policy as code, living in IaC alongside
the infrastructure it governs. All access is defined in Terraform, version
controlled, and enforced through CyberArk Identity.

- [ ] Implement `modules/aws-iam-policies/` — three roles created in the
      new account via the idsec Terraform provider:
        - `RequesterPowerUser` — the engineer who opened the issue
        - `AuditorReadOnly`    — auditors group (ReadOnly + SecurityAudit)
        - `CloudOpsAdmin`      — cloud-ops team (AdministratorAccess)
- [ ] Wire requester IAM ARN from GitHub issue opener (`github.event.issue.user.login`)
- [ ] Auditor and CloudOps principal lists sourced from GitHub secrets
- [ ] CyberArk idsec provider replaces or augments native IAM role assignments
- [ ] CyberArk auth step re-enabled in workflow (currently commented out)
- [ ] Auth endpoint: `POST {CYBERARK_TENANT_URL}/oauth2/platformtoken`

### Phase 4 — Deprovisioning Workflow
Full lifecycle: every resource created during provisioning can be torn down
via a second GitHub issue, keeping the closed-loop pattern consistent.

- [ ] New issue template: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/aws-account-deprovision.yml`
      Fields: account name, account ID, reason for deprovisioning
- [ ] New workflow: `.github/workflows/aws-account-deprovision.yml`
      Triggered by label: `deprovision-aws-account`
- [ ] Deprovisioning steps:
        1. Authenticate to CyberArk Identity (same OAuth2 flow)
        2. Remove all CyberArk role assignments from the account
        3. Move account to a quarantine OU in AWS Organizations
        4. Detach all IAM roles and policies from the account
        5. Comment full deprovisioning summary on issue and close it
- [ ] Note: AWS accounts cannot be deleted via API — quarantine OU approach
      is the correct pattern. Manual account closure via AWS console remains
      a separate out-of-band step if full deletion is required.
- [ ] New module: `modules/aws-deprovision/`

### Phase 5 — Additional Use Cases (Future)
- [ ] User onboarding — provision CyberArk Identity user + AWS role assignment
      triggered by GitHub issue
- [ ] Secrets rotation — trigger CyberArk secrets rotation via GitHub Actions
- [ ] Cross-account access — grant an existing user access to a new account
      without full reprovisioning

## Coding Conventions
- All Terraform modules follow: `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`
- New use cases go in `use-cases/<use-case-name>/`
- New reusable modules go in `modules/<module-name>/`
- New workflows go in `.github/workflows/<use-case-name>.yml`
- New issue forms go in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/<use-case-name>.yml`
- Every workflow must: authenticate to CyberArk first, use `environment: production` gate,
  comment success/failure back on the triggering issue

## CyberArk Identity Context
- Provider repo: https://github.com/cyberark/terraform-provider-idsec
- Auth endpoint: `POST {CYBERARK_TENANT_URL}/oauth2/platformtoken`
- Grant type: `client_credentials`
- Token is short-lived, masked immediately in logs with `::add-mask::`
- Token is passed to Terraform as `TF_VAR_cyberark_token` (sensitive)

## Agent Instructions (Claude Code)

When working autonomously on this repo:

1. Always read this file fully before making any changes
2. Never commit directly to main — use feature branches
3. After pushing, run `gh run watch` and wait for the workflow to complete
4. If the workflow fails, read `gh run view --log-failed` and fix the issue
5. Iterate until the workflow succeeds before declaring done
6. Do not touch files outside the scope of the current task
7. The `environment: production` gate in the workflow requires manual
   approval — note this in your output and wait for it before reading results
8. When done, summarize: what changed, what was tested, what the
   workflow output showed
